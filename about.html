            Keenan Daniels is a Stellenbosch-based artist renowned for his
            photorealistic pen and pencil sketches rendered in striking black and
            white. His work captures vintage portraits, such as iconic figures like
            Marilyn Monroe, alongside detailed depictions of animals, architecture,
            and various photographic subjects, all executed with near pixel-perfect
            precision. Primarily working with pencil and charcoal, Keenan also
            experiments by blending multiple mediums within a single piece, pushing
            the boundaries of traditional sketching to create uniquely textured
            artworks.
